When making hot coffee with one of the three whole bean bags, it was so putrid that it was only drinkable when hot chocolate powder was dumped in.\n\nThe ground coffee made barely acceptable cold brew that felt like a task rather than a pleasure to drink.\n\nDue to the variability in quality, and the downside risk when it's terrible, I would not recommend this coffee for any use.

Note to Amazon: when you put your name on the bag, you “own” the quality so I would definitely investigate these bean buyers and a cost relationship to quality.

I must say I was very excited after opening the bag and smelling the awesome aroma. My results however weren\'t so fantastic. The cold brew was what I would describe as weak, vaguely bitter and dingy. Considering all the glowing reviews I was expecting a vibrant coffee flavor! I assumed the problem might be user error so I tried multiple methods to see if I could yield a better flavor. I tried 12 hour room temperature brewing, 24 hour refrigerated brewing, a ""bloom"" (first poring boiling water over the beans to start the process) brewing. Nothing really seemed to yield that fresh, vibrant and strong coffee house flavor.

I much prefer cold brew coffee made using the beans I use every day for espresso (whole bean Lavazza Super Crema). Additionally, I grind my LSC more coarsely than Stone Street's pre-ground coffee & do so just prior to brewing. Perhaps pre-ground coffee is just not able to produce the sweet full-bodied flavor I prefer. Fresh ground whole bean LSC produces a cold brew that is a far far better tasting coffee that costs around 50% less to use than Stone Street. Finally, I buy my LSC whole beans through whole latte love."", ""*Will edit as I progress:\n\nFollowing the instructions as closely as I could manage, I just get dingy, dirty-pot tasting coffee.

Mix and steep in refrigerator for 12-14 hours. Filter via thin paper coffee filter and store in airtight container.\n\nResults: Concentrate is completely unpalatable. Literally spat it violently into the sink and rinsed my mouth out. Can be diluted 2:1 and mixed with enough sugar and cream that the nasty taste is muted and I'm basically drinking a water-sugar-cream mixture with a mild dirty-coffee undertone...\n\nEdit 1: cut the concentrate 50%, so 1 part water, 2 parts concentrate, then sweetened with 10g sugar/12 oz. actually tastes much better. Still not great. Still seems... like a very dark roast. Upping review to 3 stars. Will continue experimenting."", 'I really wanted to love this coffee. It’s a pretty good price and had a lot of good reviews. However, after brewing, it smells like cat litter. I mix in my almond milk and syrup and it makes it drinkable. It’s also a good amount of caffeine. I stay awake the whole day and have minimal yawning. But because of the smell (something about good smelling coffee in the morning is important to start the day right) I’m giving it 3/5 stars. Maybe I got a bad batch??

I use a cold brew carafe and I\'ve tried three brews. The first one was really weak, so I thought maybe I didn\'t measure enough grounds. It was like watered down iced tea. The second batch I was sure to use double the amount as the first and made sure I let it brew for nearly 24 hours, instead of the recommended 12. This one also was rather weak and watered down.
