I was looking forward to trying all three flavors.', 'Unlike so many other reviewers who loved the taste of these coffee blends enough to give it a 5 star rating, I was disappointed with all three flavors. None of them had a smooth taste, all (to different extents) tasted bitter and over-roasted. I gave each of them many tries. I varied the amount of coffee, I varied the amount of water, I used real cream, I added sugar (which I usually don’t). There was no disguising the underlying unpleasant taste. And, besides not being a smooth and pleasant taste experience, I even missed that delicious moment when the scent of coffee invades your senses as you open a vacuum sealed pack.\n\nThe Portside Blend was, to me, the worst of all. It was so strong that it wasn’t even mildly reminiscent of coffee. Even the smell seemed more of a humidor smell than a coffee bean smell.\n\nThe House Blend was a bit less pungent but still not close enough to a smooth cup of medium roast coffee. Neither the taste of the coffee, or the scent of the grind, or the scent of the coffee were particularly pleasant. I assume that there is something of the Portside Blend in the House blend because that feeling of drinking old burnt coffee still came through.\n\nThe Breakfast Blend is, while not delicious, at least palatable. It is less robust than the other blends, but it is still not a smooth drinking experience. I still find it a bit strong for my taste. It is not a coffee I will reorder but, at least, I think I will be able to finish the package myself instead of feeding it to my acid-loving gardenia plants.\n\nI can only hope that the bags I received are not representative of the brand as a whole. Maybe this batch was ruined somehow and the “real” Seattle’s Best coffee is less strident than mine.', 'When opening a brand new bag of coffee, I look forward to the punch in the face aroma of coffee. Sadly, when opening Seattle’s Best Portside Blend Medium Roast I got a faint hint of the beloved coffee bean. This was the sad foreshadowing of what my upcoming cup of coffee would bring. The coffee is ground finer than other brand name coffees. After it brewed, it visually looked to be a dark roast not a medium roast color and the welcoming smell of brewed coffee was faint and almost non-existant. And then I took my first sip. It was a mouthful of bitter and burnt. The muted coffee flavor was overwhelmed with these two tastes. It wasn’t even smooth. I tried adding cream and sugar to make it at least somewhat enjoyable and when that didn’t help I knew it wasn’t worth any more time or help. It was too late. It was just a dark cup of disappointment. I don’t know if I got a bad batch but this bag just screamed “compost me and don’t look back!”. Overall, unless you like your coffees tasting like it sat in a carafe cooking all (aka bitter and burnt), I would completely pass on this brand.', 'I can not recommend these coffees.

It\'s not my favorite cup, but that\'s just my taste. I would try a different variety next time, and go single source and organic if I\'m going to pay for it anyway. One additional note, there is no date on the packaging. Based on others\' positive reviews of the taste, I wonder if mine is out-of-date?

It's a medium roast with very mild taste.\n\nPros: it is smooth and there is no burned taste. If you like a light bodied medium roast this is for you.\n\nCons: it is not dark at all & the flavor is exceptionally light.\nThe dark coffee in the picture is death wish & the light coffee is Koffee kult dark roast."", ""New Review: Downgraded my rating from 5 to 2. When it is fresh it is excellent and they used to put the roast date on the package. Koffee Kult changed it's practice last December, however, and put the silly use by date by adding 1 year or so. Fresh coffee does not last a year! If you want to have excellent expresso the beans should optimally be less than 30 days old. If it's older the crema starts to disappear and the expresso loses it's body. It's not really their fault, Amazon has large warehouses close to customers to ensure fast delivery. For coffee better fresh than fast. For their 2 lb packages the turnover is fairly good and the lag time was usually no more than 2 weeks. The 5 lb package, however, don't sell as fast. And the last one I got was likely 2 month old. Very bad coffee. When Koffee Kult changed it's labelling policy they received many complaints.... what irritates me is that they assured me and many other customers that they go back to their old policy. Instead two months later they still have not corrected the problem. If you want to get fresh excellent beans for the same price you can buy 5 lbs for $53 including tax and shipping from Red Bird Espresso.\n\nOld Review: Freshest and therefore best coffee bean for espresso available through Amazon. I tried both dark and medium. I ordered several dark roast and they all are around 3 weeks old, however. The one medium roast I ordered was 1 1/2 month old. Three weeks is best it can be I guess because of how Amazon puts everything in their warehouses. Will be ordering dark roast from now on from Koffee Kult. You can get fresh beans directly from different roasters, but they charge quite a bit more... almost double on a per pound basis."", 'I like the air-tight bag, but that’s the only positive thing I can say about this coffee. From the first cup to the fifteenth, this coffee has been terribly boring and weak and tasteless. Because of the $26 price tag, I intended to force myself to keep grinding the beans and drinking the coffee, but I found a similar-sized bag of Peet’s at a bulk store for $11 less. As soon as I got home, I ground up a small batch of each, and did a taste test. There was no comparison. The Peet’s coffee was far superior! And significantly cheaper! And significantly more bold/dark roast! And significantly more flavorful! As for freshness, the Koffee Kult bag has a “Best By” date of next June, whereas the Peet’s bag has an actual — recent — “Roasted” date. I won’t be taking another chance on the Koffee Kult brand. Very disappointing. :(', ""I've used this bean to make French Press, Keurig, espresso, and cold brew, so I've experimented with this bean quite extensively.\n\nThe flavor is good. It's a deep, chocolatey bean. Not sweet. Not nutty. Not citrusy. If you like straight-ahead no frills coffee flavor like I do, this bean has that flavor. So why the below average rating?\n\nIt's a depressingly weak bean. My espresso came out OK, but my cold brew was a travesty of justice. Weak beyond pale, and I let my cold brews brew for at *least* 16 hours. There's no excuse for that. Same deal with the French Press: there is no excuse for a bean to make watery weak french press coffee.\n\nSupposedly the Thunderbolt is a stronger, bolder roast. I'll give that one a try, but this one is a no-go."", 'We have been drinking Kicking Horse 454 for awhile now and tried Koffee Kult Dark Roast to change things up. Short version is this coffee isn’t very good. It’s a medium roast at best and flavor isn’t very good.\n\nBy the way, oil on beans is NOT an indication of coffee being stale or bad. I roast my own beans during summer months using top quality single origin beans. Oil is an indication of roast profile. Generally a darker roast (e.g. Vienna or French Roast) results in an oily bean, even when fresh. My freshly roasted beans have oil on them just a couple days after roasting (you don’t want to drink a freshly roasted for about 48 hrs, especially dark roasts). My experience is oily beans often are the best dark roasts.', ""I had high hopes for this coffee. I am usually a Don Pablo man myself but I have been trying different dark roasts to see what else is out there. I gave the coffee 2 stars instead of 1 because at least it had caffeine in it...\n\nFirst of all this was not a dark roast. I wouldn't say it was a light roast either. Maybe a leopard roast? Its like they took a little of what ever was left over threw it a bag and said 'looks more dark than light. It's a dark roast!' A dark roast should be relatively evenly dark. The beans should be almost black and have a wonderful oily sheen to them. Take a look at the two pictures below. The Koffee Kult leopard, I mean, dark roast is on the right and a good dark roast is on the left. See the difference?\n\nI was hoping that the taste would make up for the unevenness of the beans. Boy was that a mistake. The initial taste wasn't bad while it was hot. It tasted like a light roast and, as I expected, had a buzz also similar to a light roast. About 10 minutes after my initial sip I started to get serious heartburn. I admit I have gut problems and gravitate twords low-acid coffee, but this was a foldgers level gut-bomb. As an added bonus, I started to detect a mildew flavor once the coffee cooled down. I am guessing that contributed to the afore mentioned gut-bomb. Needless to say, one cup was all I could stand.\n\nSo long story short I would save your money and look elsewhere. $27 is not a ton of cash for 2lbs of coffee but there are less expensive options out there that taste a whole lot better and won't leave you feeling like you want to yack 10 minutes after you drink a cup."", ""I buy a lot of coffee for my fellow teachers. I have had this brand before but perhaps it was a different roast. Several of us at work all thought it had a charred and bitter taste. We tried adjusting the grind and even tried different brew methods such as drip, French press, Aeropress, and Turkish. We just couldn't make it taste less bitter or charred. I will try a smaller bag of something different and see what happens. Taste is subjective so you may enjoy. It seemed fresh and had a nice crema. Shipping also took much longer than other brands we have tried. Like I said, we will give it another go before giving up on it."", 'This is no better than what I get at Costco in a pinch, maybe worse. I got a migraine the day I made it which makes me wonder if its high in mold ( a common trigger). It’s not fresh, air is in the bag and it has a best by day 18 months from now.

I had high hopes for this coffee after reading all the great reviews but it just didn\'t ""cut the mustard."" When I first opened the package... a buttery aroma made me feel like I had done the right thing by purchasing it.

After making my shot of espresso I didn\'t pick up any of the flavor notes (Chocolate, Caramel, Fruitiness, Nuts, Spice) I enjoy from the brands I typically buy (Bustelo, Illy Ethiopia, Illy Intenso, etc.) I tried it as cappuchino and felt it was flavorless and weak. Then I thought well lets add another shot to it. That didn\'t work either... it just tasted strong with no depth to it. I tried it in a regular coffee maker and though it tasted fresh... there was nothing special about it.... imagine fresh ground Folgers coffee. If I\'m paying top dollar I want top coffee. The last way I tried it was in a percolator. It was decent here.\nI did like the customer service from Koffee Kult and how they offer to give you a refund if not satisfied with their product however.', 'I believe the reviews for this coffee. However I think I received a bad batch. I have a De’Longhi La Specialista and I could not get a good ramp or a fine grind.

The true test was when I made my husband a cup of decaf Duncan Donuts coffee the flavor was so much better than this coffee!

However, to be fair, it was Vanilla French Toast by Wolfgang Puck that ended up being the 5-star in that entire set and THAT one in particular I would be willing to purchase. Refer to that review for details.\n\nBut back to THIS particular sampler, which offers 4 each of 10 flavors; alas, one of those flavors is French Vanilla by Green Mountain. As I consider vanilla to be extremely overused and the ""safe"" option and everyone knows what to expect with vanilla, I\'m not going to bother reviewing it. It\'s good, just not remarkable (unlike Wolfgang Puck as above). My goal with morning coffee is variety. No matter how good a coffee is, I really don\'t want the same one every day, so having a sampler is the best choice for me because otherwise I could take up an entire kitchen cabinet stacked with boxes of different flavors.\n\nFrom an aroma standpoint, every brand included has very aromatic coffees. They smell fresh and are eye opening just in that regard.

The Cinnabon and the Gloria Jean Raspberry Chocolate Lava I would deem to be dessert coffees. I rarely want them first thing in the morning (morning for me is 3am) as their aroma can come across as cloying but with cake or pie or even just later in the morning as cup #2 are great choices. Caribou Caramel Hideaway has the rich, smooth notes of caramel without the sweet. I love it and it\'s my favorite of the sampler. Gloria Jean\'s Butter Toffee and the Kahlua both have a balanced flavor and light aroma and are good first-thing-in-the-morning choices and I\'m very fond of these too. Donut Shop\'s Coconut Mocha and Nutty Caramel: I don\'t really detect coconut, nut, or mocha in these and more emphasis seems placed on the coffee bean itself IMO, and I\'m good with that. I try to imagine that if I was eating a plain cake donut with either of these coffees, the pairing would be perfect. Less interesting and typically left for last (second to boring vanilla) is the Gloria Jean Hazelnut, another highly overused flavor and seems acidic to me. Good, yes I suppose, but not all that noteworthy, not when compared to the above. Green Mountain Southern Pecan is okay but their Caramel Vanilla Cream is the better of the two. The common denominator in many of these is the caramel which offers a really nice smoothness to offset acidity.\n\nBuy this flavor pack.

This is likely due to the fact that these k-cups are loose inside the shipping box and the labels on each flavor of a brand look very similar; those filling these shipping boxes are probably paid by the box and are not paying close attention to the numbers. Not a big deal, but can be frustrating when your favorite flavor is one of those affected.\n\nAnother issue with the loose shipping is that some of the k-cups are damaged enough to cause grounds to be in the mug/cup after brewing.

I made up a pot for myself and a few of my coworkers. I actually warned each of them this is supposed to be really strong, as I didn't want a heart attack blamed on me. I have to say, I wasn't skimpy on the grounds but I also wasn't packing them in either as given the price point I really would like to stretch this out to more than 3-4 pots.\n\nCoffee is very smooth, and really lacks any bitterness. Also didn't notice any heartburn/indigestion like I get sometime. Where was the caffeine punch though?? I didn't notice any difference than a normal cup. I do have a pretty decent caffeine tolerance (that I attribute to hundreds of Monsters and Red Bulls) but still expected a little more here. I've made two more pots, each with a little more grounds added, but still haven't noticed anything. Kind of makes me think a lot of the over the top reviews I've seen are just from people looking to get top rated. Or maybe I'm just cynical.\n\nOverall, its a very smooth rich taste and enjoyable to drink, but the caffeine did nothing for me. I was more concerned with flavor anyway, but felt this wasn't SO good as to justify the price point. Organic and fair trade is nice, but I think I will probably switching back to something off the grocery store shelf."", 'I like the coffee..

I was disappointed that it was not strong coffee, which is what I expected. It was smooth, not acidic, and not bitter. That's good. It tastes good and it seems to have an extra caffeine kick. It's worth a try. I don't think I'll spend another $20 on a second package. I've found that mixing this with some Guatemalan coffee makes a flavorful combination. So I am enjoying the adventure."", ""The only reason I gave this coffee a 4 stars instead of 5 is because it is a little pricey. Also because I'm not yet convinced its the strongest coffee out there! I plan to shop around some more! This coffee definitely has more of a kick to it than your regular coffee. such as Folgers. However, the bag said to add 2 tablespoons per 6 oz of water. I did that and it barely covered the bottom of the coffee filter so I added another tablespoon and decided to give it a try. As I said before it definitely had more caffeine than your average Joe coffee brands, but the cup I drank did not wake me up more than a monster juice does. All in all, I found the flavor to be very nice and smooth. It is stronger than average coffee, but is a little on the pricey side!!!

I started brewing it at half-speed to assure I didn't shock my body...I didn't know and I was correct. I used a little over a table spoon to brew a single cup, as opposed to my usual 2-3. You can definitely feel the kick. I equate it to a triple Americano. One drawback, in my opinion, is you should only use this in a pinch. I brewed it daily, and over time I noticed my tolerance building up, probably not a good thing (I do not drink triple Americanos everyday). I would trade the taste of this over an Americano (and most coffees) any day. Another drawback is the price. If you're hung over a lot, maybe a good investment. For daily use, probably not worth the money, among other things. This is a quality product to be used on occasion. I suggest keep air tight in the freezer. Serve this to friends and family...observe their behavior. JK."", ""It is EXPENSIVE - dear lord! It is literally 2.5 x the cost per ounce of Amazon's organic peru grind. It tastes good and in my opinion is better than Amazon's Peru blend but not 2.5 x better.

Caffeine-wise, the first morning I brewed this I was HYPER like a little kid but my body adjusted to the increased caffeine after 5-6 days straight of drinking DW and it now gives me a pleasant morning pick me up. The biggest downside is price. Unfortunately this has a luxury price tag and I can find high quality, fresh roasted beans locally for a fraction of the cost so I’m going to keep this as a special occasion purchase (around the holidays, for gifts, etc).

It does have a nice flavor but if you brew any other good roast at the same ratio it would be a fair test which I have done and found that on a level playing field there are many good coffees at a lower price that easily compete. Is it worth $20??? Perhaps, because it is good. Serving size for one cup of coffee is considered to be 6oz. My cup is 12oz. That is 5 tablespoons of Death Wish Coffee?? One must summize that 2x the coffee will yield 2x the caffeine so everything else is only good marketing\nUPDATED: I increased my rating to 4 stars because I have found that for strong coffee many roaster recommend up to 2 tablespoons to 6 oz.

If its not fresh and you can tell because the smell doesn't hit you when you open the bag, and the grinds don't bubble when you do a pour over, then its around 8oclock level of coffee. I like that its organic, free trade, etc... but freshness is imiportant. I bought a two lb pack, and the first bag I had was NOT fresh, and the second one was.

The front of the bag has a ziploc seal, and the bag I got was just about the most frustrating thing I have ever tried to close. The way the bag was manufactured caused the halves of the ziploc seal to be misaligned, making it nearly impossible to close. I am an engineer with decent dexterity and it took me 6 tries to close the bag one time. Another time it seemed like it was closed and it wasn't, and I accidentally left it unsealed. If the resealing system is bad, it defeats the entire point of offering a resealable bag.\n\nIf you buy this, ignore the ziploc seal and open the bag from the top as usual, you will probably get a better seal by folding the bag over and using a bag clip than you would with the ziploc on here, and it will save you the frustration."", 'What I like most about this product is that it was roasted by Koffee Kult, whose coffees are consistently good and whose customer service is stellar.

The beans smelled and tasted almost identical to ""Joe\'s Dark Roast"" from trader Joe\'s (an extremely mediocre dark roast). The aroma and flavor both lacked the depth and complexity found in Peet\'s, Starbucks and other good dark roasts. Hard to tell the freshness since there was not a roasting date on the bag, but they did not smell extremely fresh. Also, there was a LOT of air in the bag, it was not vacuum sealed. I played around with the grind size, and brewed both in my bonavita pour over maker as well as a French press. The press tasted better than the pour over with this bean, but still nothing ground breaking with these two methods.\n\nSticking with Starbucks and Peet\'s for daily pot of coffee, will use these beans when I brew the moka pot.', 'First off I cold brew my coffee. I grind the beans coarsely and then put them in a large glass container and brew them in the fridge over night. I then take it out and filter it and store again in the fridge for the next few days. I use whole cream in my coffee. I am a high fat diet person. Now the coffee. I can say that this is a bold coffee. It is not bitter at all, but still has a nice strong flavor. It has a bit of a burnt tinge to it but it is a dark roast so that is not unexpected. I would say that this is one of the better dark roasts out there. The beans are oily which means they have been roasted very recently. Some snobs would say that you should not use coffee so freshly roasted but wait a week for it to off gas a bit. I am not sure if that is true but I made this coffee the day I received it and then again just today and it is the same. It may brew differently with hot water but I have not tried it that way. I have a bag of the Medium roast as well but have not tried it yet. I will post that after I try it. I did roast this coffee and Subtle Earth Medium Dark roast side by side and I would say that they were close, but the Koffee Kult had a bolder taste since it was all dark roast. If you like dark roast I would definitely give this brand a try. The reviews are accurate but it did not blow me away with the first cup so I think 4 stars is accurate and the smell was good but not the best I have smelled.', ""Very good coffee, and a good value for the money. My first batch was prepared with a hand cranked burr grinder and a french press. I use a standard water filter pitcher with generic cartridges. This produced a very strong, yet smooth, beaker of coffee with a rich aroma that you can only get from fresh ground beans. The roast is lighter than I expected, but it wasn't a disappointment at all.\n\nDo not buy if you don't have a good storage solution for whole beans! You'll need an air-tight container, preferably something with a CO2 valve but this is not essential. Do not just store the beans in the bag, they'll go stale long before you finish 2 pounds of coffee even if you have a heavy daily habit."", 'Good coffee.

I'm pulling ristrettos, more-or-less, and with a number five grind over a longish period (more than 30 seconds for a ristretto, from my limited coffee knowledge, is pretty long).

Definitely a coffee for those who are attracted to terms like ""robust"", ""deep"", ""rich"", and ""strong"".\n\nAs such, I happily give this Koffee 4 out of 5 stars. I am deducting 1 star because, as of May 12, 2015, the coffee costs $12.50 a pound. Perhaps, given its eco-friendly process, this might actually be a competitive price. I don\'t know. All I know is that I am able to find really great tasting and good quality coffee between $6 to $10 a pound. And, if a person is like myself where they desire strong coffee, they will use a lot of beans to create that perfect cup. My wife and I easily go through 1 pound a week. Which means we are paying $50 a month in coffee if this was our go too brew.

With a modicum of milk and sugar, however, it\'s not bad. Like Cafe Domingo, the Portside Blend does not have any noticeable fruity notes, which is a big mark in its favor. For the last week, I\'ve been brewing a pot, chilling it, and bringing it to work as a treat. This is giving me a bit of a caffeine OD, however, so beware.

American-style coffee blends of this kind used to be called ""blond,"" but they were not meant to be sand-colored, just less roasted.

I liked it hell of a lot more than Folger\'s highly touted ""1850"" morning style, which costs considerably more.

It can be a lot of blueberry flavor all at once. I could drink pumpkin and pumpkin spice coffee all damn day but this is a very sweet and flavored coffee I could do maybe once a week or as an after dinner dessert coffee.\n\nIf you want subtle this ain’t it.

You can definitely feel the kick. I equate it to a triple Americano. One drawback, in my opinion, is you should only use this in a pinch. I brewed it daily, and over time I noticed my tolerance building up, probably not a good thing (I do not drink triple Americanos everyday). I would trade the taste of this over an Americano (and most coffees) any day. Another drawback is the price. If you're hung over a lot, maybe a good investment.

It does have a nice flavor but if you brew any other good roast at the same ratio it would be a fair test which I have done and found that on a level playing field there are many good coffees at a lower price that easily compete. Is it worth $20??? Perhaps, because it is good. Serving size for one cup of coffee is considered to be 6oz. My cup is 12oz. That is 5 tablespoons of Death Wish Coffee??

The \ufeffcoffee is good quality, and it all appears to be a medium grind that works well in my drip coffeemaker. It’s small batch roasted for freshness, and all the coffee tastes fresh for pre ground. The variety pack includes four flavored coffees. Three are medium roasts with unspecified “flavoring” and one is a bold roast infused with chicory. This also has four unflavored coffees that are medium or bold roasts. I brew everything strong and add steamed milk with honey or sugar.\n\nThe Creme Brûlée and Chicory Coffee stand out as my favorite of the flavored coffees. Creme Brûlée smells and tastes like caramelized sugar laced with vanilla. The flavor is distinct but not overpowering. I can get a medium bodied brew that’s smooth and not bitter, and milk and sugar bring out a dessert like flavor. The Chicory Coffee is on the opposite end of the spectrum. It’s bold and nutty, and savory instead of sweet. Last I had chicory coffee was many years ago at Café Du Monde and this has that familiar chicory taste. It’s good really strong with sugar and steamed milk for a Café Au Lait. Both are quite enjoyable.\n\nThe Vanilla Creme is good too, though nothing unusual. It has a vanilla aroma and taste that isn’t heavy handed and taste more like real than artificial vanilla. I can brew it strong enough so it’s medium bodied but still tastes smooth. The Texas Pecan is my least favorite and is just okay for me. I’ve tried different ratios but get a thinner, lighter brew than I prefer. It’s very drinkable but I’m just not crazy about the aroma or taste as the nuttiness is kind of weak and nondescript, and I get an aftertaste. This one is just very average to me. But overall the flavored coffees are are smooth and seem good for fans of flavored coffee.\n\nThe unflavored coffees are all pleasant and very drinkable. The City Roast and Costa Rica blend are medium roasts that brew strong are medium bodied, balanced, smooth and not overly acidic or bitter. The City Roast tastes like a breakfast blend to me. I do think the Costa Rica blend tastes a little richer and more flavorful. The Colombian is good and is more full bodied brewed strong. It tastes more flavorful, yet it’s mild with no strong characteristics and not too bitter. I’m a big fan of dark roast coffee, but French Roast can taste charred and bitter, while also being too thin. This is actually one of the better French Roasts I’ve tried as it’s smoky but not burnt tasting, and the bitterness is pleasant.

Overall though, these blends are all rather finer grinds that will serve well with drip coffee makers or espresso machines if your machine will accommodate pre-grinded coffee."", ""This is a good variety pack for the price.

Three rounded scoops, tablespoons, for the approximately 20oz. Of water. I wasn't expecting it to turn out as well as my usual brand but it actually turned out better. Using water just below boiling I simply poured over the coffee filter and waited. The fragrance was there but how about the taste? I use light cream and a couple three sugar cubes for my taste and took the first sip sitting in front of the computer. I have to say I was very impressed. Very mild with no noticeable bitterness. A great taste. I can only compare it with one other thing. Ever had fantastic coffee ice cream? I kid you not. I seldom have company but when I do I use a small electric drip coffee maker and that too turned out well enough so my guests complimented me on my coffee skills. Okay so I have one friend who is a Starbucks fan and thought the coffee too weak. She now stops before she comes so no more listening to her moaning. All I can say I'm very impressed with the coffee. The coffee would had received 4 1/2 stars but Amazon doesn't allow that. The star deduction,half star , deduction , is because I believe the package is weak.

It should be smooth and velvety, like dark chocolate - not overly bitter. This is a huge downfall of many dark roasts, and one that the Post Alley Blend gracefully avoids. It's a cup I'd be happy to buy at a Seattle's Best location, and also one that tastes great brewed at home on my less sophisticated equipment. I have been buying Post Alley for over a year, and I have yet to find a bag that comes up stale or bitter. If you like Starbuck's dark roasts, you will love Seattle's Best Post Alley. In fact, I believe they share a parent company.\n\n2. It should be forgiving of less-than-perfect brewing methods. I'm sorry, but I'm not going to do a pour-over every morning. I'm just not. I'm going to set the timer on my drip coffee maker so I can have my cup when I awake. If you've ever had to buy coffee at a gas station, you know firsthand how awful brewing methods can spoil an otherwise great coffee. While a fresh pour-over is always the best, I'm not displeased with the results of my janky brewing methods. Post Alley still tastes smooth and fresh.\n\n3. It should retain the unique characteristics of the bean. This is one of the most difficult boxes for a dark roast to check, since the very process of roasting the beans to dark removes much of the original bean's nuances in flavor. Only extremely demanding roasters can achieve this, and this is the only area where I mark off one star. This is not unique to Post Alley, of course. I'd put this up against any of the dark roasts from other major chains. It doesn't really matter if you're drinking Seattle's Best, Starbucks, Caribou, etc. - The only roasters that check this box for me are local boutique roasters (and perhaps Dunn Bros.) So take this not as a criticism, but simply a commentary on big-market dark roasts in general. How to fix this? I don't know, since I suspect the very act of mass-roasting prevents dark roasts like this from matching up to the top of the line.\n\nSo would I recommend this? Very strongly, yes. I would say any of Seattle's Best dark roasts, including this one, would not displease any but the most demanding consumers. If you drink it black, you'll love it. If you don't drink it black, I'm sorry, but it doesn't really matter what you drink - buy the cheapest since you're already killing the taste with sugar and cream. I'd highly recommend Post Alley Blend. Seattle's Best in general has become a staple in my house since it is budget friendly and tastes just as good as the more expensive brands."", 'An intensely-flavored smokey coffee. It\'s finely-ground enough that you could get away with using it in an espresso maker, which means it\'s far too fine for a French Press, and maybe too fine for a mesh filter.\n\nThe flavor is very dark, much like a French Roast. If you drink your coffee black, you may want to dial back the dosage by a half-tablespoon. Seattle\'s Best is of the same PNW heritage as Starbucks (and is now owned by Starbucks). If you like dark roasts such as Starbucks favors, you\'ll like this one. If you\'re one of those who thinks starbucks tastes ""burnt"", you should pass on this.\n\nI\'m not normally a fan of pre-ground coffee. But if you\'re space-limited, or not super-interested in the nuances of coffee, it can still be convenient -- just make sure to use it up briskly after opening. Recommended for a strong, smokey coffee.', ""Coffee in America is so much better than it used to be, if you know where to look. I credit companies like Seattle's Best and Starbucks with bringing back rich flavorful coffees - coffees that make the stuff you get at IHOP and Cracker Barrel fade into the tasteless distance. This Post Allen blend is a satisfying dark French roast that is somewhat smoky and very smooth - not bitter like some other dark roasts. I like it best made with a coffee maker with a conical filter. It's great with breakfast or any time of the day. I also find it makes good espresso if I run it through my grinder for a finer, almost powdery, grind.\nThis is good stuff and worth the money.\nADDED LATER - This coffee has a higher caffeine content than my other coffees, leaving me feeling jittery and wired after two cups. Maybe it's just me, but I think it's worth mentioning."", ""I usually grind my coffee beans just before making the coffee, and predictably, this preground coffee is not as tasty as that. However, I have to say it is pretty good. As advertised, it's a dark roast, which suits my tastebuds just fine. The flavor is dark and smoky but not overwhelming and not too “one-note.” A word of warning: The “best by” date on the bag is more than a year away, and even though the coffee is carefully sealed in valved bags, I honestly don't think year-old coffee is the way to go, so as always, keep an eye on those dates. I would rather have seen a “roasted on” date, but it doesn't matter for me at this point because the coffee is currently very tasty, and it will be long gone before a year has passed!"", ""I like strong French Roast coffee, and I drink it black, and this does the job. It is strong, dense, and doesn't have the bitter edge that I find in Starbucks coffee. Is surprisingly smooth for a dark roast.\n\nI got the ground coffee, so they've done a good job of grinding it themselves.\n\nI went from a light roast to this bag, and the difference was big. Personally, I don't mind light roasts, but I always find them too watery and less coffee - this brand is all coffee!\n\nBe aware - it's a dark roast and they mean it. So for those light coffee drinkers out there, this will be a wake-up. I liked it a lot!"", ""This dark roast from Seattle's Best has a deep aroma and taste. You will notice this as soon as you open the bag, but upon making a brew, you could really sense its richness. I like creamer in my coffee, but even with creamer, the flavor of the coffee shines through whereas the creamer rounds out any bitterness that you might get from straight coffee. So in that respect, I really enjoyed this coffee much more than I thought I would. You get three 12oz bags of the dark roast that gets shipped nicely in a box."", 'If you are not a fan of dark coffee than you will not enjoy this coffee. I like my coffee to punch me in the face but my husband likes it milder. As it was brewing, my husband commented on how he could smell it from the living room. Two rooms away from the kitchen.

I drink locally-roasted coffee, and as well, I drink a lot of Starbucks. I usually buy whole beans and grind them each morning.

It’s not bitter at all.

Most coffee sites recommended to freeze them unopened, which is the only time we should freeze or refrigerate coffee (moisture and all that). I’m curious to see how this coffee will taste after storing it like that. The opened bag goes in an opaque container, still in it’s bag and also in a zip lock bag.\n\nFor the price and considering it’s shipped out instead of roasted fresh, it’s good coffee.

It has flavor, though nothing particularly stands out about it. It's a solid cup of coffee suitable for everyday drinking.

If you just want a reliable cup without too many frills, then this might be a good option for you.\n\nI decided that I could only give this coffee four stars because it markets itself as a French roast, yet it doesn't really taste like a French roast. French roast is supposed to be very dark, almost burnt. Sure, the beans are pretty dark (though I've seen darker). But this coffee doesn't taste particularly dark to me. I'm not saying it's bad. I'm just saying that I would have expected a French roast to have a smokier flavor.\n\nIf you want a true French roast, you might want to avoid these beans, but if you're looking for a solid everyday coffee at a relatively affordable price, I think you might want to give these a try.""]",4

Well, you know - it's just Folgers. I stumbled upon this Peet's Big Bang, and the name caught my attention - so did the size of the bag (20oz) and the price ($12.58 at the time). I ordered it, I brewed a pot at work one morning, I poured myself a small cup to try ... I was instantly hooked - and so were my coworkers. This coffee is absolutely delicious - it's smooth, and there is no bitterness to it whatsoever. I've never been so enamored with a cup of brewed coffee. I've tasted many, many brewed coffees - at cafes and restaurants, at people's houses, at churches I've attended - and nothing has ever even come close to this stuff. I still get my Starbucks every morning, but I also pour myself a cup of Peet's when I get to work and I savor it. I'm tinkering with the idea of brewing a double-strength batch to see how it holds up as iced coffee, but in the meantime, I'll enjoy it hot, room temperature, and eventually cold as my morning goes on. No matter the temperature, its deliciousness holds up. And I've placed several more orders - I even had some coworkers kick in some cash so we can keep this in stock as long as possible.

Nice. . . .\n\nHere\'s something I tried: I fill a 16-oz Tervis Tumbler with water, pour it into my Farberware percolator (also a good deal on Amazon), then load into the perc\'s basket a full scoop of this coffee, plus two of the cheaper (typically store) brand. After it percolates, I pour the coffee into my tumbler (the percolator, btw, makes it ""McDonald\'s hot""), then pop the top off the percolator, along with its basket lid, and re-pour that same load through the same coffee grounds to make it really strong.\n\nYep. ""Double-poured"" coffee. Don\'t repercolate, just pour it through the spent grounds in the perc\'s basket. Wait for it to finish ""gravity dripping"" through and then replace the perc basket\'s lid, recover the pot and pour it out -- move fast to keep it hot.\n\nNow doubly strong, I pour it back into my Tumbler and add a teaspoon of unsweetened, organic cocoa powder (good deals for this also on Amazon) lus an ounce of half-and-half.\n\nTHAT is the way this old boy prefers to wake up each morning.\n\nAnyway, my ""store brand mix"" trick doesn\'t just save me money. It also modulates the McD\'s flavor to just the right mix of richness and nutty-ness.

The best way to get what you want, how you want it is to buy the raw beans, roast and grind yourself. But who has time for that?\n\nSo we decided to have another kid... I love the kid, but he has the lungs of a screeching spider monkey that just hit the lottery. So getting the average of 30 minutes of sleep at a time, our Nespresso and Keurig single cup makers couldn\'t keep up come morning. I know what you\'re thinking, (you say you\'re a coffee snob but you use a keurig?!"" .. Yes.. when you\'re getting negative sleep each night, convenience is nice. Not saying it\'s a great cup of coffee, but it satisfies well enough. The Nespresso makes a pretty solid cup of coffee, but the cost per pod is much higher. I can\'t afford to spending all that money for pods with as much as we\'re drinking lately... that\'s like a Ferrari a week. So here we are... with a drip pot. Add that to our pour over, french press, two pod makers, moka... our house looks like a Starbucks on steroids. But hey, for the sake of quantity and money, we\'ll give it a shot. So I went in search of a great roast...\n\nThis was the real uphill battle.. a battle that took us through every roast on the store shelves, and many through Amazon. We searched high and low for a good roast, our taste buds longing for a good cup of coffee... but all we found was bitterness, weak roasts and acidity that would make drinking from a car battery enticing. We tried to fine tune amounts... ultra filtered water.. we even mixed various roasts together, which actually helped.. but who can live like that?! So the journey continued... with fear we may never have good coffee again. Sure, at this point going on -5671 hours of sleep, the caffeine was a primary issue, keeping me from turning into Gollum... and we were still being supplied that. But our taste buds longed for something good again. Our search continued, until one day we were at a discount store and bought a bag of Kicking Horse to try. At this point, with all the money we were wasting on bad coffee I practically had to work overtime and get a second job.. (just kidding... but seriously...) we started grabbing some to try at the discount store. Brought this puppy home - our first bag of Kicking Horse - and was excited to try it. I looked at the bag and my heart dropped like a lead balloon. On the side, it said ""Decaf"". After shaking my head in shame and wondering what my wife was going to say about my man card, I decided to try it. To my surprise, it was a very good roast... especially for a demonic, perverted thing like Decaf! But we still needed caffeine... we\'ll keep that Decaf for a rainy day when we no longer need the caffeine.. like when the kids get married or something.\n\nThis whole occurrence however, was my gateway to Kicking Horse. We decide to try some of their other roasts, since the Decaf reeled us in. I ordered the Three Sisters, Kick @$$, and Smart @$$. We usually like a darker roast, so I thought I\'d like that one best, but I found it a little weak to be honest. Still good taste, and no bitterness... kinda like that good old hunting dog. He\'s a good dog, loyal, but doesn\'t really help you out. Then I tried the other two, and Three Sisters blew my socks off! For a medium roast, it was a nice strong roast. No bitterness or harsh acidity, and the flavor profile was amazing! My first taste of this was Heavenly... as if the angels were singing. Seriously... if I could tap an iv of this straight into my bloodstream I would.\n\nSo there it is... best roast I\'ve had in a long time. My only regret is that they don\'t sell it by the pallet full.\nKid still sleeps horrible, but hey... at least we can have a good cup of coffee in the morning that not only gives us caffeine, but also is enjoyable to drink. Thanks, Kicking Horse!!', 'This isn’t a review for the coffee itself, but the packaging job. Looks like the packer dropped their chewing gum right into this little crevice. Disgusting!

For years I was loyal to café Lareño, an artisan whole bean coffee grown and roasted in Lares, Puerto Rico. When that coffee was difficult to find, I changed to Alto Grande, a local coffee sold in whole beans, too.

That doesn\'t mean that I don\'t enjoy other varieties for a change of pace: I\'m also particularly fond of Ethiopian; Guatemalan; and Mexican. But my standby has been Columbian all my adult life, For many years (40+ I would imagine) my Columbian store-bought, stand by was ""Brown Gold"". For me, it outclassed everything else on the store shelves and even many of the boutique/specialty brands (I was never a Starbuck\'s fan---reminds me of birch tar). Cup after cup, year after year, Brown Gold hit the spot for me. It was usually the most expensive coffee on the shelf, but I felt it was well worth it.\n\nAnd then one day, they stopped selling Brown Gold----I mean, Mother Parker\'s just stopped producing it! I couldn\'t believe they stopped selling this outstanding product. I went into serious withdrawal and deep mourning. I\'ve been on a quest for a replacement for several years now. Recently, I ""chanced"" Don Pablo\'s Columbian Supremo right here. BINGO!\n\nRight out of the package, the beans smell divine. The roasting is perfect. (Brown Gold was a medium roast and I thought I preferred that). Don Pablo is a medium-dark roast that hits the spot for me. They advertise ""low acidity"" and I don\'t know how they accomplish that but it\'s true---it\'s very low acidity which I appreciate; some mornings, it permits me \'another cuppa\' without the reflux. The aroma is marvelous (fills the entire house) and the flavor components, are downright wonderful. I\'ve always maintained that coffee aroma and taste rarely match, .i.e., the aroma far-and-away beats the flavor; for this brand, they are neck-in-neck, A spectacular find! And the price? Just amazing.\n\nThis coffee is a worthy replacement for my beloved, Brown Gold.

I prefer it over the other, but I drink it black so I really can taste it. If you put anything in the coffee you might not tell the difference and their other Signature Blend coffee is lower cost.

I don't know why but the other brands come out slightly sour and have a tart aftertaste. You have to add more sweet cream to make it more enjoyable whereas the Gevalia grinds have been lovely, no sourness and smells wonderful after 24 hours of cold brew. Even the aroma is different compared to the other brands when the coffee is completed, smells just like Starbucks. The Starbucks pouches uses 70% South American and 30% African blends. Both Costa Rica and Guatemala were smooth and rich, but Guatemala was better. Costa Rica is more fruity and citrusy (sour hints). Guatemala is earthy and rich with no sour notes at all.

I was very good, but a very fine grind which made the amount of sediment a bit annoying so I ordered a few bags of the whole from directly from Gevalia. PLEASE NOTE: ordering from Gevalia directly included a torturously long hold time waiting for custoner service made even more frustrating by the ridiculously long time it took for them to ship and for me to receive necessitating two...count \'em TWO...followup calls attempting to identify and solve the shipping delays (what can I tell ya, Amazon has spoiled me PLUS it is less expensive here!!!). THEN upon receipt I was confused by the fact that I ordered the Traditional Roast which was described as a ""light roast"" but the bag read ""Medium Roast"" Well, another call and L-O-N-G wait time for customer service later, complete with several transfers...they explained that BEFORE GRINDING it is considered a ""MEDIUM Roast"" but THAT the grinding process renders the ground coffee a milder product...and they were actually right!! Needless to say, I have since ONLY ordered from Amazon!!! :-)\n\nANYWAY, now finally the coffee review! Choosing a few notches just below medium grind on my Burr Grinder...the coffee produced a wonderfully S-M-O-O-T-H, slightly nutty cup of coffee with a delightfully subtle chocolaty finish!! There was NOT A HINT OF ACIDITY, or the otherwise ensuing excruciating heartburn, yet deep, multi-layered and held up PERFECTLY despite my addition of a bit half and half!\n\nAs time has gone on I have experimented, tweaking here and there with amounts of coffee and strength/boldness settings per pot (I DO enjoy a stronger cup for both hot and iced) the final brewed product HAS NEVER sent me running for the antacid OR longing for the days of being able to tolerate the darker roasts.\n\nAll in all...I am an exyremely satisfied, even mildly purring, REAL coffee drinker once again!

I just assumed that came with all coffee, honestly. The coffee beans I've noticed seemed to be ground a bit more than other brands I've ever tried, almost to the point it would seem for espresso, but no, it's definitely regular coffee.

I’ve been trying (fairly successfully) to find the tastiest cold brew for the least price, which is the easiest and least messy to make. Here’s my review of Bizzy’s cold brew beans!\n\nSo, first off Bizzy’s offers a value in line with others here on Amazon @ under $1 per oz of grounds, can’t knock em there. It seems like a medium course ground, which worked fine for me and I didn’t have any sludge issues. As for taste, after brewing a couple batches I found that it definitely lives up to the sweet & smooth claims, as it packed some very pleasant sweet flavor without too much of the acidic bitter taste that some beans produce with cold brew. My routine is to drink 1 cup of cold brew each morning, with a 50/50 dairy mix (milk or cream). I honestly think my morning Bizzy + cream drinks are better than what coffee shops are selling for $5 a cup. There are several good bean options on Amazon and Bizzy is among the best I’ve tried.\n\nBtw- for those wondering, I took some pics to show how I make the brew. Like I said before, my goal is to brew a quality batch of brew without making a mess.\nI fill a cold brew filter (I use these cold brew filters with about ¾ cup of grounds.\n2.) Next I Place the filtered grounds in about one half a gallon of water in a mason jar\n3.) I usually brew in the fridge for about 24 hours until it reaches the darkness level I prefer\n4.) Lastly, no mess clean up by throwing the filter into the garbage to stop the brewing process\n\nThen I just keep my cold brew in the refrigerator and enjoy on ice with milk or cream each morning @ a cost of under $1 per drink. So, this is my experience with Bizzy and I’m pretty happy with the results. Hope you find it helpful.\n\nThis was my sole opinion. I was not given free or discounted product.', 'I’m not a coffee drinker, but my husband is, and has recently become a huge Starbucks cold brew fan. I figured in an effort to save money, I would learn to make concentrated cold brew at home, so he had it available to him at all times, especially during the hot summer. Well, after a few experiments with water/coffee ratios and such, I have to say, he absolutely loves the flavor of Bizzy cold brew more than anyone else’s, including a Starbucks. I make a 2 week supply (because that’s how long it keeps in the fridge) and he drinks every last drop. I’ve ordered it 4 times so far, and will continue to do so.', 'I\'ll be honest, coffee on Amazon is mostly hit or miss. It\'s miss mostly, let\'s be honest here. I hardly if ever buy ground coffee, especially from Amazon, as it\'s usually nothing but old bags(this doesn\'t exclude whole bean, same thing honestly). However, I got ir today, and didn\'t really feel like cold brewing it today(I was out, didn\'t want to wait). I did drip method at work, using water at 200F. I did pour some of the water over it before starting it though(I swear this helps if you\'re doing any hot extraction. I also added some salt(I promise this will do wonders to any hot drip). But after all was said and done, it produced wonderful coffee. I always drink mine with italian sweet cream, but honestly I coukd drink it black, it was that smooth and ""sweet"". Unfortunately...... Upon driving home, that entire gallon spilled.... At least I got a cup before that happened. I ordered another bag though, and if the next bag is just as good I\'ll be sure to say.\n\nI still have to do cold brew though. So, I can only expect it to be even better. I\'ll be sure to let you know.\n\n*update* After cold brewing, I can say that yes, it\'s very good like it was via hot extraction. However, very very subtle differences. The second bag was just as fresh, I think.\n\n*update* I ordered a dash rapid cold brewer to try with these grounds, and it was good there too. However, I may stop using that device. While yes, it makea good coffee.. I\'m having to use 2 cups to make 50oz as strong as a 400 gram/1 gallon ratio. If I keep using that I\'ll end up spending more money than I would be if I were going to a coffee shop everyday. This is not the coffees fault, it\'s the machine.\n\n*edit* I have one more ""coldbrew"" blend of beans to try. I\'ve tried Bizzy, Tiny footprint, and stone street. Thus far, Bizzy is still my favorite. Followed by stone street, and tiny footprint. Keep in mind, tony footprint was whole bean, and I most definitely expected them to be better, as freshly ground is usually always better, regardless of who you buy from.

My understanding is that cold brew grind is coarser than normal coffee grind. That was one reason I was putting off trying the cold brew maker - I wasn't sure of the grind.

I was one of them and this taste great with a splash of coconut creamer and a packet or two of stevia in the raw.\n\nPicked this up along with a different brand when I was first venturing out to see what is the best coffee for cold brewing. At the time, I was fairly new to the coffee world, never cared for it because the roast flavor kept me away from it. On top of not liking the roast, I hear hot coffee has high acidity so for those who need to be mindful of acid reflux, cold brew is the way to go. This brand in particular isn\'t too sweet and the roast is just right. I highly recommend this for first time drinkers to long time drinkers. It\'s a steady flavor with nothing crazy like hazelnut or whatever else which I don\'t care for. With a tiny bit of creamer and some sugar, you\'ll be able to taste a nice roast flavor without being punched in the mouth from a overbearing taste. Give a try, you won\'t regret it!\n\nSome tips for people new to cold brewing:\n\nFirst off, get this coffee brand!\n\na coffee canister with a Co2 valve to keep it fresh (I have the coffee gator. They have a 25% off deal going on so check it out and it also comes with a 1/8th cup scoop)\n\norder two of the amazon choice ""Takeya Patented Deluxe Cold Brew Iced Coffee Maker with Airtight Seal & Silicone Handle"" the 2 quart size ones, they also have a 2 dollar off coupon on it as well right now. It might be expensive to order two but trust me, two is the way to go since you can have one brewing which takes up to 24hrs (I actually let the coffee steep until I finish off the other one) so having one ready and having one brewing would insure you won\'t be out. As for how much coffee ground to put in, the coffee canister I suggested (coffee gator) comes with a 1/8 cup scoop, I would would put 5/8th cup into the mesh strainer or 5 scoops for those who don\'t care for fractions and let it steep until I run out of coffee from the other container. If you drink about 12-14oz a day, this should last you about 3ish weeks until you have to order more Bizzy cold brew coffee. Oh and I haven\'t actually tried to continue to use the same ground from a previous batch so I have no idea if it would taste like diluted coffee water or the same as a fresh made one.\n\nI hope this helps! Have a great day!', 'I used it to make cold brew concentrate. It sat in the fridge 24hrs and looked kind of light (like black tea) but it didn’t taste “weak” it tastes vibrant, yummy and very complimenting to sweet tooth syrups like Jordan’s Skinny-Syrup caramel, maple bourbon, and s’mores flavors.

I've tried this with both French press and drip maker and it makes a great cup regardless of brewing method."", 'Like this coffee. Good full bodied flavor. More of a chocolate and nutty flavor (to my palate) and I like how fresh the beans are when you receive them. There is even still oils on the beans and when I grind and make my pour over you can see lots of activity bubbling up with the first pour. I like rotating this with either Brazilian and/or Guatemalan beans. Very good coffee and I like that they try to minimize their impact on the world but planting trees.', 'Really enjoying this coffee. I make espresso and long black shots with it and it is really shining. I am going to have to add this as a regular. Very smooth and bold and so wonderful. Its hard to limit myself to two cups a day with this one.', 'I loved it! I am becoming more picky after having tried a dozen of coffee brands from Nicaragua, Costa Rica and Panama, and one from Brazil... Many (not all) were really good. But this one came as fresh as I have never seen, The beans had a oily appearance and smelled so-o good! The oily look disappeared after a few days, but, importantly, the flavor of the coffee was rich and pleasant, strong enough but not bold. I used a manual grinder to make small servings. So far it was my favorite. I will try it again!', 'I\'ve tried a LOT of different coffees, including being in a subscription club for small batch coffees, and I have to say as an overall ""experience"" THIS is the best.

If you love Kona Coffee as much as me, but drink way too much to make the high pricetag affordable, then this is the best way to go if you\'re not friends with a Coffee Farmer.\nThere\'s nothing bad I can say with this. It\'s bright and light. Slight vanilla and chocolate notes, just the way Kona blends usually are. This light roast qualifies best as a Breakfast Blend, yet can be enjoyed all day and afternoon. Makes a great Cold Brew as well. Low in tannins and bitterness. Best enjoyed percolated or slow brewed to develop the flavors depth. Light enough to be a great cup of Black coffee too!', ""Really good stuff, sweet finish and not to bitter or acidic.

I highly recommend this product!!"", ""Such a good flavor from New England Coffee. I don't like when flavored coffee tastes medicinal and this one tastes great, it smooth and will fill your kitchen with the French vanilla scent. Plus it's cheap!!

The price was very affordable so I had nothing to lose. Drinking my first pot (6 scoops in my 11 cup mr. coffee) and it is fabulous! Not too much vanilla so its not overkill.

Mostly because of the declining quality in their coffees, the lines waiting for to order, the lines waiting as the quantities of the specialties are made and then waiting for your name to be shouted out.\nFor the time it would take me to go get coffee at Starbucks, I can make a cup of Laughing Man coffee I can enjoy at my own home, not in my car, rushing to work because the line at Starbucks was extra long that morning and hoping I don't spill it in a rush trying to get to work on time.\nLaughing Man coffee may take a little effort by actually having to make it yourself, I hope as more people try it, they'll remember how to enjoy coffee again.

I enjoy it very much and it's worth every quiet sip in the morning before heading out for the day.\nMaybe it also has to do with the proceeds going back to programs that help the coffee growers and their families with their health, growth and success.\nThis review wasn't meant to offend anyone, I respect all coffee lovers, even those devoted to Starbucks, as my best friend is.
